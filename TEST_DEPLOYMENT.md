# Deployment Test Guide

## 🧪 Testing Your GitHub Pages Deployment

### 1. Basic URL Test

Visit: **https://SubhashGuptha30.github.io/subhash-portfolio/**

Expected behavior:

- ✅ Homepage loads without 404 error
- ✅ Loader animation appears
- ✅ All sections are visible

### 2. Direct Route Testing

Test these URLs directly:

**Project Routes:**

- https://SubhashGuptha30.github.io/subhash-portfolio/#/project/0
- https://SubhashGuptha30.github.io/subhash-portfolio/#/project/1
- https://SubhashGuptha30.github.io/subhash-portfolio/#/project/2

**Personal Space:**

- https://SubhashGuptha30.github.io/subhash-portfolio/#/personal-space

**Invalid Routes:**

- https://SubhashGuptha30.github.io/subhash-portfolio/#/invalid-route

### 3. Navigation Testing

1. Click on project cards
2. Use browser back/forward buttons
3. Test internal navigation links

### 4. Feature Testing

- ✅ Search functionality in certificates
- ✅ Filter dropdowns
- ✅ Grid/List view switching
- ✅ Image galleries
- ✅ Share buttons
- ✅ Download functionality

### 5. Mobile Testing

- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Touch interactions
- ✅ Mobile navigation

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Still Getting 404 Errors:

1. **Clear Browser Cache**

   - Press Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
   - Or open in incognito/private window

2. **Check GitHub Pages Settings**

   - Go to your repository settings
   - Navigate to Pages section
   - Ensure source is set to "Deploy from a branch"
   - Branch should be "gh-pages" and folder "/ (root)"

3. **Wait for Deployment**

   - GitHub Pages can take 2-5 minutes to update
   - Check the Actions tab in your repository for deployment status

4. **Check Console Errors**
   - Open browser developer tools (F12)
   - Look for any JavaScript errors in the Console tab

### HashRouter vs BrowserRouter

**Current Setup (HashRouter):**

- ✅ More reliable for GitHub Pages
- ✅ No 404 issues
- ✅ URLs have # symbol (e.g., /#/project/1)
- ✅ Works immediately

**Alternative (BrowserRouter):**

- ❌ Requires 404.html file
- ❌ More complex setup
- ✅ Cleaner URLs (e.g., /project/1)
- ❌ Can have routing issues

## 📊 Expected Performance

- **First Load**: 2-3 seconds (due to loader)
- **Navigation**: Instant
- **Images**: Should load within 1-2 seconds
- **Search/Filter**: Instant response

## 🐛 Common Issues

### 1. Assets Not Loading

**Symptoms**: Missing images, broken CSS
**Solution**: Check that all asset paths are relative or include base path

### 2. Router Not Working

**Symptoms**: Can't navigate to project pages
**Solution**: Verify HashRouter is being used

### 3. Loader Not Showing

**Symptoms**: No loading animation
**Solution**: Check if JavaScript is enabled and console for errors

### 4. Search/Filter Not Working

**Symptoms**: Search box doesn't filter results
**Solution**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors

## ✅ Success Indicators

Your deployment is successful if:

- ✅ Homepage loads without errors
- ✅ All images display correctly
- ✅ Navigation works (both internal and direct URLs)
- ✅ All interactive features work
- ✅ Mobile responsive design works
- ✅ No console errors

## 🚀 Next Steps

If everything is working:

1. Share your portfolio URL
2. Test on different devices/browsers
3. Monitor for any user feedback
4. Consider adding analytics

If issues persist:

1. Check the browser console for specific errors
2. Verify all file paths are correct
3. Consider switching back to BrowserRouter with proper 404 handling
